:::{.cr-section}

The end of the first two lines of a Limerick must rhyme. [@cr-limerick]{highlight="cr-mallory,cr-salary"}

The end of the third and fourth line also rhyme and are nudged in a bit. [@cr-limerick]{highlight="3-4"}

And everything [@cr-limerick]


| {#cr-limerick}
| There was a young rustic named [Mallory]{#cr-mallory},
| who drew but a very small [salary]{#cr-salary}.
|   When he went to the show,
|   his purse made him go
| to a seat in the uppermost gallery.
